This {{learningplan.name}} demonstrated how easy {{offering.name}} can be leveraged to protect and archive regulated data. Users learned the basics for provisioning and managing COS resources. But there is still more to learn about COS. Links to specific COS topics were provided throughout this demonstration guide. Take the time to read the official <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started-cloud-object-storage" target="_blank">PowerVS documentation</a> to learn the full capabilities of the offering.

Finally, remember to complete the {{learningplan.name}} learning plan.

**IBM Sales** and **IBM Technical** sales must complete a Stand and Deliver exercise to validate their ability to demonstrate COS to potential clients. Refer to the evaluation rubric in the learning plan when preparing the Stand and Deliver.

**Business Partners** (both sellers and technical sellers) must pass the COS Level 3 quiz from learn.ibm.com. Remember, take the quiz while the reservation to the TechZone environment is active. The Business Partner quiz verifies use of the demonstration environment and not general knowledge of the COS offering.
