IBM Cloud Object Storage provides **command line interfaces (CLI)** as a plugin to the IBM Cloud CLI. The COS CLIs provide users the ability to programmatically manage their COS environment and objects without having to use the IBM Cloud Portal.

In this chapter, explore a variety of CLI instructions that can be issued via the IBM Cloud Shell portal. The topics covered in the next chapter include:

- Configuring the COS CLIs
- Inspection of COS services and buckets
- Uploading content to a COS bucket
- Downloading content from a COS bucket
- Deleting content from a COS bucket

There are man COS CLI instructions which can be issued â€” our goal is not to be exhaustive and not go into every command in detail, but rather provide a representative sampling of jobs that can be performed programmatically via the CLI. Using this foundational knowledge, more tailored demonstrations can be crafted for specific client needs.

In addition to the COS CLI, there are also COS Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), COS Software Development Kits (SDKs) and libraries, and the ability to use other tools like Client URL (cURL), the Amazon Web Services (AWS) CLIs, and rclone to manage content stored in COS. You can learn more about these in the Reference section of the COS documentation <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-compatibility-api&code=javascript" target="_blank">here</a>.
