By default, COS bucket management events are collected automatically, but collection of data events is optional. Each bucket must be configured to enable collection of data events. In this demonstration script, **Activity Tracker** is enabled to collect all COS-related activity. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard.
