The first step to getting started with IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) is to create a COS service instance. The terms **resource instance** and **service instance** refer to the same concept, and can be used interchangeably.

The COS service instance is a container that will hold buckets that are created within the instance along with other COS related resources like integrations, endpoints, etc. The main configuration aspect of COS associated with the service instance is the pricing plan.
