Welcome to the {{learningplan.name}} demonstration guide! The goal of this demonstration guide is to provide IBM and Business Partner Sales and Technical Sales with the knowledge and tools to perform hands-on demonstrations of {{offering.name}}. Throughout this demonstration guide {{offering.name}} will be referred to as COS.

While everyone is encouraged to complete all sections of the demonstration guide, actual completion requirements vary by role:

- IBM Sales:

    * Complete Parts 1 through 7 of this demonstration guide
    * Record and submit a Stand and Deliver demonstration to be evaluated by management (details in the Your Learning plan)

- IBM Technical Sales:

    * Complete **all** Parts of this demonstration guide
    * Record and submit a Stand and Deliver demonstration to be evaluated by management (details in the Your Learning plan)

- Business Partner Sales:

    * Complete Parts 1 through 7 of this demonstration guide
    * Successfully pass a 5 question quiz found in the learn.ibm.com plan

- Business Partner Sales:

    * Complete all Parts of this demonstration guide
    * Successfully pass a 5 question quiz found in the learn.ibm.com plan

**IBM Sales and Tech Sales** must develop and record a Stand & Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate delivery of a “live” demo in front of a client — on camera. IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points the customer has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording will then cover the seller’s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client of the value of the IBM solution using the environment and techniques of this lab. Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand & Deliver recordings is provided within the documentation that accompanies the Level 3 course in Your Learning.

**Business Partners** must pass an accreditation quiz after completing the hands-on portion of the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. **Hint: keep the demonstration guide and the associated IBM Technology Zone environment active while completing the quiz.**

Before jumping to part 1, please read the guidance below. Reading and understanding the information will save time while completing the steps in this guide.

**In this demonstration environment, full access to the IBM Cloud account is NOT provided.** User identifications (IDs) will be restricted to specific capabilities. Permission to create or modify COS service instances, COS buckets, Key Protect instances, etc. is not provided.

!!! warning
    Attempting to perform an action without the appropriate permissions will result in an error message like the one below. This is not an issue with the IBM Cloud or COS, rather a restriction of the demo environment and the permissions assigned to users.
