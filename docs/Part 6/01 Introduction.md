The final provisioning step is to create a COS **bucket**. Files that are uploaded into COS are called **objects**.  Objects can be anywhere from very small (a few bytes) to very large (up to 10TB). They are organized into **buckets** that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle.

In the IBM Technology Zone environment used in this demonstration script, two buckets have been pre-provisioned. All users of the environment will utilize the same buckets, and users are restricted to specific actions on the buckets that align with the goals of the regulated archive scenario.

In the next chapters, watch a video of one of the buckets in this environment being created and then use the click-thru demonstration to walk through the process.
