Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets. The goal of this demonstration guide is to illustrate how to perform a demonstration of COS that addresses a specific pain point many clients have: management of regulated data. The scenario shown in this guide is based upon a Regulated Archive Demonstration originally created by the COS product management team. Learn more about this scenario here in Seismic in the IBM Regulated Archive entry of The Seller Essentials section. Note, the COS integration with Security Compliance Center is changing and may be going away. Ignore that aspect of the solution described in the above documents. Security Compliance Center is not used in this demonstration guide. Important All users of this demonstration guide should have a working knowledge of the IBM COS offering. While not a pre-requisite for the IBM Cloud Object Storage - Level 3, it is recommended that all users complete the IBM Cloud Object Storage Level 2 badge: IBM LINK TO L2 Business Partner LINK TO L2 In this demonstration environment, full access to the IBM Cloud account is NOT provided. IBM Cloud user identifications (IDs) will be restricted to specific capabilities. The IBM Technology Zone utilized in this demonstration guide is shared by all users. Permission to create or modify COS service instances, COS buckets, Key Protect instances, etc. is not provided! Additionally, expiration and retention periods are set in days rather than months are years which would be more typical in a real-life regulated archive solution. These restrictions are in place to minimize costs, provide an easy-to-use, pre-built environment for this learning activity, and provide an environment for general client demonstrations on very short notice. Since the Technology Zone environment used in this demonstration guide is shared and pre-built, several activities are simulated through videos and click through (click-thru) demonstrations. These include Parts 2 through 6 and Part 9. It is important to note these activities are most likely ones that would be completed prior to a client demonstration to save time. Parts 7 and 8 are hands-on activities where users will perform tasks directly associated with the regulated archive demonstration including uploading data to COS and managing retention of the data including creating legal holds. The image below is a high level illustration of the regulated archive workflow and the components of the solution: COS, IBM Key Protect, and IBM Cloud Activity Tracker. Using the above diagram, in this demonstration guide, Step 1 - Classify data sets is not performed. Rather it is assumed clients will best understand their data requirements and based upon those requirements will specify the configurations set in Step 2 - Create regulated data archive . Step 2 - Create regulated data archive aligns with Parts 1 thru 6 of the demonstration script. In these Parts, videos and click-thru demonstrations are provided that show how all the IBM Cloud components of this demonstration were created and configured. This includes: Part 2 - Create a COS service Part 3 - Create a Key Protect service and root key: Part 4 - Create an service authorization between COS and KeyProtect Part 5 - Create an Activity Tracker service: Part 6 - Create a COS bucket: Each of the above Parts include an introduction that will describe each component, its function, and the configurations used for the demonstration. Step 3 through Step 7 in the diagram above aligns with Part 6 and Part 7 of the demonstration script. These Parts will use the IBM Cloud Portal and COS command line interfaces (CLIs) to do activities including: ingest data into COS specify object-specific retention durations place legal holds on data restore data attempt to delete data from COS to validate retention policies and legal holds are honored Additionally, IBM Cloud Activity Tracker will be used to perform mock audit activities. Time to get started. Proceed to Part 2 to watch and practice how a COS service is created.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Part%202/01%20Introduction/","text":"The first step to getting started with IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) is to create a COS service instance. The terms resource instance and service instance refer to the same concept, and can be used interchangeably. The COS service instance is a container that will hold buckets that are created within the instance along with other COS related resources like integrations, endpoints, etc. Again, this demonstration script assumes a working knowledge of COS. If these terms are not familiar, refer to other COS training or the COS documentation here . The main configuration aspect of COS associated with the service instance is the pricing plan . Details about COS pricing can be found in the IBM Cloud Portal here and in the Billing and pricing section of the COS documentation. For this demonstration, the Smart Tier pricing plan was chosen to minimize costs of the demonstration environment. In a client engagement, the client's actual access patterns and other requiremnts will drive the pricing plan selection. For a longer term archive solution, vault, Cold Vault, Archive, and/or Accelerated archive plans are more likely to be used. Additionally, client's can create multiple service instances that utilize different pricing plans.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Part%202/02%20Watch/","text":"In this chapter, watch a video of an IBM Cloud Object Storage service being provisioned in the IBM Cloud Portal.

Expand the first event delete event in the Dashboard by clicking just to the left of the entry. Notice the following fields in the event that are now audit ready. Because the expiration for the object was set with a three (3) day retention period, the object can not be removed. This object will remain in COS until either one of the following two actions occur: The object is deleted after the 3 day retention period by someone with appropriate permissions. The object is automatically deleted after the 7 day expiry occurs that is set on the bucket. Notice there is a second bucket that has been provisioned with no retention policies: cos-l3-without-retention. Feel free to use this bucket as part of client demonstrations. In the next chapter, explore how legal holds can be used to further protect regulated data.","title":"Manage regulated content"},{"location":"Part%207/04%20Legal%20holds/","text":"Another means to protect regulated date is through the use of Legal holds . Certain objects might need to be prevented from modification after a retention period expires. An example is an incomplete legal review, where records might need to be accessible for an extended duration beyond the retention period originally set. A legal hold flag can be applied at the object level. Legal holds can be applied to objects during initial uploads or after an object is written. Note: A maximum of 100 legal holds can be applied per object. Follow the steps below to create a legal hold on an object. If not already open, open new browser tabs or windows to the IBM Cloud Portal COS bucket details and Activity Tracker as described in Steps 1 and 2 of the previous chapter. Click the Upload button. Click the Upload files button. In the Choose Files to Upload dialog, select the a file to upload to COS, and click Upload . Click the up arrow next to the Organize your objects (advanced) section of the Upload dialog. Set Duration to 0 Days. Enter a unique name in the Legal hold text entry field. Click Upload . A Transfers dialog will open and after the file uploads, a success message will appear. Close these windows by clicking the X at top right of each. Recall how in the last chapter how it was possible to delete an object that had a retention period of 0 days. Now, try and delete the document just upload that has a retention of 0 days AND a legal hold . Select the newly uploaded document and click Delete objects . Click Delete in the Delete object dialog. Notice the Delete failed. An error message should have appeared stating the Delete failed due to an attached policy. Switch to the Activity Tracker Dashboard. Click to the left of the last delete object-batch event in the Dashboard. The legal hold on the object prevents the object from being deleted even tough the retention period is set to 0 days. Return to the IBM Cloud Portal, click on the last object added to view the object details page. Click the Retention tab. Click the Trash can icon to the right of the Legal hold created earlier. Click Delete in the Delete Legal Hold dialog. The legal hold has now been removed. A new entry in Activity Tracker should reflect the object has been updated as shown in the image below Now that the legal hold has been removed, the object can be deleted as it's retention period is set to 0 days and there are no legal holds on the object. Technical sellers should proceed to Part 8 and explore the COS command line interfaces (CLIs). That concludes the required parts of the demonstration script for IBM and Business Partners Sales. All are encouraged to complete Parts 8 and 9, but at this time IBM and Business Partners Sales may skip to Next steps .","title":"Legal holds"},{"location":"Part%208/01%20Introduction/","text":"IBM Cloud Object Storage provides command line interfaces (CLI) as a plugin to the IBM Cloud CLI. The COS CLIs provide users the ability to programmatically manage their COS environment and objects without having to use the IBM Cloud Portal. In this chapter, explore a variety of CLI instructions that can be issued via the IBM Cloud Shell portal. The topics covered in the next chapter include: Configuring the COS CLIs Inspection of COS services and buckets Uploading content to a COS bucket Downloading content from a COS bucket Deleting content from a COS bucket There are man COS CLI instructions which can be issued \u2014 our goal is not to be exhaustive and not go into every command in detail, but rather provide a representative sampling of jobs that can be performed programmatically via the CLI. Using this foundational knowledge, more tailored demonstrations can be crafted for specific client needs. In addition to the COS CLI, there are also COS Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), COS Software Development Kits (SDKs) and libraries, and the ability to use other tools like Client URL (cURL), the Amazon Web Services (AWS) CLIs, and rclone to manage content stored in COS. You can learn more about these in the Reference section of the COS documentation here .","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Part%208/02%20Manage%20regulated%20content%20with%20COS%20CLIs/","text":"For this exercise, the IBM Cloud Shell will be used so no additional software is required.

In this chapter, a similar scenario as seen in Part 7 will be used where files will be uploaded, retention periods set, and attempts to delete the objects will be made. To facilite the scenario, a script is provided that will automatically download the 6 image files to the IBM Cloud Shell environment. Important Be sure to utilize the demonstration guides copy icon to avoid typographical errors in executing commands. Download the script to download the images files. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IBM/SalesEnablement-COS-L3/main/docs/includes/downloadImageFiles.bash Execute the script to download the images files, and when prompted, enter a unique prefix to use in the file names (e.g. arj123). bash ./downloadImageFiles.bash Verify the files now exist in the IBM Cloud Shell environment. ls *.jpg Example output arj123-check1.jpg arj123-check2.jpg arj123-check3.jpg arj123-check4.jpg arj123-check5.jpg arj123-check6.jpg Next, in order to use the COS CLIs, a few configuration steps must be completed. Set the COS region to us-south. ibmcloud cos config region --region \"us-south\" Example output OK Successfully saved default region. The program will look for buckets in the region us-south. Retrieve the Cloud Resource Name (CRN) for the COS service instance COS-L3-service.
