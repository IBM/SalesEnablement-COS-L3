The goal is to provide IBM and Business Partner Sales and Technical Sales with the knowledge and tools to perform hands-on demonstrations of IBM Cloud Object Storage. Throughout this demonstration guide IBM Cloud Object Storage will be referred to as COS. To complete the IBM Cloud Object Storage - Level 3 badge requirements, IBM and Business Partner sellers must complete Parts 1 through Part 7 of this demonstration guide. IBM and Business Partner technical sellers must complete all sections. Everyone is encouraged to complete all sections. All modules are accompanied by recordings and narrated instructions, delivered by your team of authors. Be sure to watch these for a visual demonstration of how to perform the hands-on lab components. In particular, it is strongly recommended that IBM Sellers and Technical Sellers watch these recordings \u2014 they will be useful for you as you go about creating and recording your own Stand & Deliver presentations for Level 3 accreditation. IMPORTANT To receive Level 3 accreditation, IBMers and Business Partners must demonstrate mastery of the skills learned throughout coursework. Level 3 accreditation requirements\u2014 and the way participants will be evaluated before receiving accreditation \u2014differs depending on job role. IBM Sales and Tech Sales must develop and record a Stand & Deliver presentation. This video is intended to simulate your delivery of a \u201clive\u201d demo in front of a client \u2014 on camera. IBMers will have flexibility in defining a hypothetical client, the pain points that customer has, and the goals they aspire to achieve. The recording will then cover the seller\u2019s hands-on demonstration and pitch to the client of the value of the IBM solution using the environments and techniques of this lab. Specific criteria that must be demonstrated as part of the Stand & Deliver recordings is provided within the documentation that accompanies the Level 3 course in Your Learning. Business Partners must pass an accreditation quiz after completing the hands-on portion of the course. The quiz consists of multiple choice questions, with four possible responses (and only one correct answer) for each question. Before jumping to part 1, please read the guidance below. Reading and understanding the information will save time while completing the steps in this guide. FIND HELP If at any point during the hands-on material you need help from the team of authors and other IBM experts, please connect with us via the #cloud-platform-demo-feedback Slack channel. Any comments or suggestions are also welcome in this channel. Helpful tips for using this demonstration guide and environment The IBM Cloud Object Storage- Level 3 Demonstration Guide is organized in parts and sub-parts or chapters. Most chapters contain numbered steps, which are actions to be performed. Throughout the guide, images are used as examples of the IBM Cloud Portal, IBM Cloud Shell, and PowerVS instance consoles. Warning The IBM Cloud Portal and IBM Cloud Object Storage changes on a regular basis and may differ from the images captured in this guide. In some images, the following styles of highlighting are utilized: Action highlight box: Illustrates where to click, enter, or select an item: Path/explore highlight box: Illustrates one of two things: the path to follow to get to a specific location in the user interface areas to explore Copy to clipboard box: The text is copied to the clipboard. Click the copy icon (highlighted below) and then paste using the operating systems paste function, for example, entering Ctrl +v , Cmd +v , or right click and select paste. Additionally, there are several \"click-thru\" demonstrations. Links to click-thru demonstrations will open in a new browser window or tab with a screen similar to the image below. Click the play button in the middle of the screen to start the demo. Then, simply follow the steps in the demonstration guide. If unsure where to click, click anywhere on the screen and a highlight box will appear showing where to click next. In this demonstration environment, full access to the IBM Cloud account is NOT provided. User identifications (IDs) will be restricted to specific capabilities. Permission to create or modify COS service instances, COS buckets, Key Protect instances, etc. is not provided. Warning Attempting to perform an action without the appropriate permissions will result in an error message like the one below. This is not an issue with the IBM Cloud or COS, rather a restriction of the demo environment and the permissions assigned to users. Acronyms The following acronyms are used throughout this demonstration guide: - Application programming interfaces (APIs) - Cloud Object Storage (COS) - Classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) - Control (ctrl) - The control key on keyboard - Command (cmd) - The command key on keyboard - Disaster Recovery (DR) - Gigabyte (GB) - High Availability (HA) - IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) - IBM Power Systems Virtual Server (PowerVS) - IBM Technology Zone (TechZone) - Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) - Input/output operations per second (IOPs) - Internet Protocol (IP) - Operating System (OS) - Random access memory (RAM) - Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS) - Secure Socket Shell (SSH) - User identification (ID) - Virtual Machine (VM) It is now time to proceed to Part 1, an overview of IBM Cloud Object Storage.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#helpful-tips-for-using-this-demonstration-guide-and-environment","text":"The IBM Cloud Object Storage- Level 3 Demonstration Guide is organized in parts and sub-parts or chapters.
