Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets.</p> <p>The goal of this demonstration guide is to illustrate how to perform a demonstration of COS that addresses a specific pain point many clients have: management of regulated data. The scenario shown in this guide is based upon a Regulated Archive Demonstration originally created by the COS product management team. Learn more about this scenario here in Seismic in the IBM Regulated Archive entry of The Seller Essentials section. Note, the COS integration with Security Compliance Center is changing and may be going away. Ignore that aspect of the solution described in the above documents. Security Compliance Center is not used in this demonstration guide.</p> <p></p> <p>Important</p> <p>All users of this demonstration guide should have a working knowledge of the IBM COS offering. </p> <p>In this demonstration environment, full access to the IBM Cloud account is NOT provided. IBM Cloud user identifications (IDs) will be restricted to specific capabilities. The IBM Technology Zone utilized in this demonstration guide is shared by all users. Permission to create or modify COS service instances, COS buckets, Key Protect instances, etc. is not provided! Additionally, expiration and retention periods are set in days rather than months or years, which would be more typical in a real-life regulated archive solution. These restrictions are in place to minimize costs, provide an easy-to-use, pre-built environment for this learning activity, and provide an environment for general client demonstrations on very short notice.</p> <p>Since the Technology Zone environment used in this demonstration guide is shared and pre-built, several activities are simulated through videos and click through (click-thru) demonstrations. These include Parts 2 through 6 and Part 9. It is important to note these activities are most likely ones that would be completed prior to a client demonstration to save time. Parts 7 and 8 are hands-on activities where users will perform tasks directly associated with the regulated archive demonstration including uploading data to COS and managing retention of the data including creating legal holds.</p> <p>The image below is a high level illustration of the regulated archive workflow and the components of the solution: COS, IBM Key Protect, and IBM Cloud Activity Tracker.</p> <p></p> <p>Using the above diagram, in this demonstration guide, Step 1 - Classify data sets is not performed. Rather it is assumed clients will best understand their data requirements and based upon those requirements will specify the configurations set in Step 2 - Create regulated data archive.</p> <p>Step 2 - Create regulated data archive aligns with Parts 1 thru 6 of the demonstration script. In these Parts, videos and click-thru demonstrations are provided that show how all the IBM Cloud components of this demonstration were created and configured. Each of the these parts include an introduction that will describe each component, its function, and the configurations used for the demonstration.</p> <p>Step 3 through Step 7 in the diagram above aligns with Parts 6, 7, and 8 of the demonstration script. These Parts will use the IBM Cloud Portal and COS command line interfaces (CLIs) to perform activities including:</p> <ul> <li>ingesting data into COS</li> <li>specifying object-specific retention durations</li> <li>placing legal holds on data</li> <li>restoring data</li> <li>deleting data from COS to validate retention policies and legal holds are honored</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, IBM Cloud Activity Tracker will be used to perform mock audit activities.</p> <p>Time to get started.

The terms resource instance and service instance refer to the same concept, and can be used interchangeably.</p> <p>The COS service instance is a container that will hold buckets that are created within the instance, along with other COS-related resources like integrations, endpoints, etc. Again, this demonstration script assumes a working knowledge of COS. If these terms are not familiar, refer to other COS training or the COS documentation here.</p> <p>The main configuration aspect of COS associated with the service instance is the pricing plan. Details about COS pricing can be found in the IBM Cloud Portal here and in the Billing and pricing section of the COS documentation. For this demonstration, the Smart Tier pricing plan was chosen to minimize costs of the demonstration environment. In a client engagement, the client's actual access patterns and other requirements will drive the pricing plan selection. For a longer term archive solution, vault, Cold Vault, Archive, and/or Accelerated archive plans are more likely to be used. Additionally, clients can create multiple service instances that utilize different pricing plans.</p>"},{"location":"Part%202/02%20Watch/","title":"Watch a COS service being created","text":"<p>In this chapter, watch a video of an IBM Cloud Object Storage service being provisioned in the IBM Cloud Portal.</p> <p>This video includes audio that explains the steps being taken and things to consider while making choices on options.

Technical sellers do not need to include this content in their Stand and Deliver recordings, nor will Business Partners be quizzed on this content. It is included here purely for educational purposes.</p> <p>While creating the IBM Technology Zone environment used here, the developer for this demonstration guide learned something new that other technical sellers may benefit from when attempting to properly restrict access to IBM Cloud resources. If users are not already familiar with the ability to create custom Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, this information may prove useful.</p> <p>It has been mentioned several times in this demonstration guide that user IDs in the IBM Technology Zone environment for this demonstration script are restricted. To accomplish this, when the user's IBM Cloud ID is added to the IBM Cloud account, the ID is also added to two IAM access groups: Public Access and a custom group named COS-L3. Learn more about access groups here.</p> <p>Access groups are used to organize a set of users in a container that makes it easy to assign specific sets of access roles for one or more services like COS. Each IBM Cloud service can specify roles that have specific capabilities for the service. One role may be called Reader which restricts the user ID to only read capabilities. In the case of COS, a user with only Reader capability could perform get operations on an object but not write or put operations. Roles can be assigned across the entire service or be more narrowly scoped, for instance to a specific service instance.</p> <p>In this demonstration environment, the COS-L3 access group is shown in the image below:</p> <p></p> <p>Notice the group includes three (3) services: Cloud Object Storage, IBM Cloud Activity Tracker, and Key Protect. And each of these is scoped to a specific resource, which in this case is the service instance used in the demonstration environment. And for each resource, specific roles are assigned. Now this is all fairly basic IAM capabilities.</p> <p>Notice, however, that one role for COS looks different. The role has the name COSL3MODwriter. This is a custom role that was defined specifically for this demonstration script. Why was this custom role needed? Recall in the demonstration script, users had the ability to upload content to a bucket, download content from a bucket, create a legal hold, remove a legal hold, but NOT modify the buckets that were pre-provisioned. While the Reader role provided the download and query access for objects, and the Object Writer role provided the ability to upload objects, the ability to delete an object and manage legal holds are not provided by the Object Writer role. Those capabilities are provided in another role called Writer. So why not use the Writer role instead of Object Writer? Because Object Writer also provides the access to create new buckets and remove buckets. Providing users with that capability would allow any user of the shared environment to create any number of buckets and remove the shared buckets. Not good.</p> <p>Now the aha moment. There is the ability in IAM to create a custom role, in this case COSL3MODwriter. Custom roles allow administrators the ability to combine any number of actions for a specific service. The COSL3MODwriter custom role looks like:</p> <p></p> <p>Notice, the 5 new actions being added:</p> <ul> <li>cloud-object-storage.object.delete</li> <li>cloud-object-storage.object.delete_version</li> <li>cloud-object-storage.object.get_legal_hold</li> <li>cloud-object-storage.object.post_legal_hold</li> <li>cloud-object-stroage.object.post-multi-delete_version</li> </ul> <p>By augmenting the standard Reader and Object Writer roles with the custom role, the COS-L3 access group now provides the correct permissions to complete the scenarios defined in this demonstration script.</p> <p>The brief, 2 minute video below shows the creation of both the COSL3MODwriter custom role and the COS-L3 access group. The video does NOT have narration.</p> <p></p> <p>Tip</p> <p>If the video appears blurry, click the fullscreen  or ![](_attachment</p>"}]}
