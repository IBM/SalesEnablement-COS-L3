Unstructured data (sometimes called binary or \"blob\" data) refers to data that is not highly structured in the manner of a database. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets. The goal of this demonstration guide is to illustrate how to perform a demonstration of COS that addresses a specific pain point many clients have: management of regulated data. The scenario shown in this guide is based upon a Regulated Archive Demonstration originally created by the COS product management team. Learn more about this scenario here in Seismic in the IBM Regulated Archive entry of The Seller Essentials section. Note, the COS integration with Security Compliance Center is changing and may be going away. Ignore that aspect of the solution described in the above documents. Security Compliance Center is not used in this demonstration guide. Important All users of this demonstration guide should have a working knowledge of the IBM COS offering. While not a pre-requisite for the {{ no such element: dict object['learningplan'] }}, it is recommended that all users complete the IBM Cloud Object Storage Level 2 badge: IBM LINK TO L2 Business Partner LINK TO L2 In this demonstration environment, full access to the IBM Cloud account is NOT provided. IBM Cloud user identifications (IDs) will be restricted to specific capabilities. The IBM Technology Zone utilized in this demonstration guide is shared by all users. Permission to create or modify COS service instances, COS buckets, Key Protect instances, etc. is not provided! Additionally, expiration and retention periods are set in days rather than months are years which would be more typical in a real-life regulated archive solution. These restrictions are in place to minimize costs and to provide an easy-to-use, pre-built environment for this learning activity and that can be leveraged for general client demonstrations on very short notice. Since the Technology Zone environment used in this demonstration guide is shared and pre-built, several activities are simulated through videos and click through (click-thru) demonstrations. These include Parts 2 through 6 and the Part 9. It is important to note that these activities are most likely ones that would be completed prior to a client demonstration to save time. Parts 7 and 8 are hands-on activities where users will perform tasks directly associated with the regulated archive demonstration including uploading data to COS and managing retention of the data including creating legal holds. The image below is a high level illustration of the regulated archive workflow and the components of the solution: COS, IBM Key Protect, and IBM Cloud Activity Tracker. Using the above diagram, in this demonstration guide, Step 1 - Classify data sets is not performed. Rather it is assumed clients will best understand their data requirements and based upon those requirements and will specify the configurations set in Step 2 - Create regulated data archive . Step 2 - Create regulated data archive aligns with Parts 1 thru 6 of the demonstration script. In these Parts, videos and click-thru demonstrations are provided that show how all the IBM Cloud components of this demonstration were created and configured. This includes: Part 2 - Create a COS service Part 3 - Create a Key Protect service and root key: Part 4 - Create an service authorization between COS and KeyProtect Part 5 - Create an Activity Tracker service: Part 6 - Create a COS bucket: Each of the above Parts include an introduction that will describe each component, its function, and the configurations used for the demonstration. Step 3 through Step 7 in the diagram above aligns with Part 6 and Part 7 of the demonstration script. These Parts will use the IBM Cloud Portal and COS command line interfaces (CLIs) to do activities including: ingest data into COS specify object-specific retention durations place legal holds on data restore data attempt to delete data from COS to validate retention policies and legal holds are honored Additionally, IBM Cloud Activity Tracker will be used to perform mock audit activities.

The terms resource instance and service instance refer to the same concept, and can be used interchangeably. The COS service instance is a container that will hold buckets that are created within the instance along with other COS related resources like integrations, endpoints, etc. Again, this demonstration script assumes a working knowledge of COS. If these terms are not familiar, refer to other COS training or the COS documentation here . The main configuration aspect of COS associated with the service instance is the pricing plan . Details about COS pricing can be found in the IBM Cloud Portal here and in the Billing and pricing section of the COS documentation. For this demonstration, the Smart Tier pricing plan was chosen to minimize costs of the demonstration environment. In a client engagement, the client's actual access patterns and other requiremnts will drive the pricing plan selection. Vault, Cold Vault, Archive, and/or Accelerated archive plans are more likely to be used. Additionally, client's can create multiple service instances that utilize different pricing plans.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Part%202/02%20Watch/","text":"In this chapter, watch a video of an IBM Cloud Object Storage service being provisioned in the IBM Cloud Portal.

Before getting started, a few important notes. As mentioned before, this is a shared environment. All users of the environment have the ability to upload, download, and delete all content added to the pre-provisioned buckets. Users should only work with objects they create. Do NOT upload any files that contain confidential or proprietary information. Note also, as a safeguard, all uploaded objects will be removed after 7 days using an expiry rule set on the COS bucket. For this demonstration script, users should create 4 to 6 small files that will be uploaded to COS. While COS will accept any tile type and files can be very large, users are encouraged to utilize small files to minimize upload times. The following links can be used to download 6 sample bank checks that can be used. To download, right click on the links below and depending on browser select: \"Save link as\" - Chrome and Firefox \"Download linked file as\" - Safari Important When saving the file, add a unique prefix to the file name.

You can learn more about these in the Reference section of the COS documentation here .","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"Part%208/02%20Manage%20regulated%20content%20with%20COS%20CLIs/","text":"To be written: For this exercise, the IBM Cloud Shell will be used so no additional software is required.
